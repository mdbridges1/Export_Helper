# Export Helper

This add-on is designed to quickly export every object in your blend file to one of 4 formats:
+ GLB (glTF 2.0 binary)
+ OBJ
+ FBX
+ FBX for Unity

I developed it as part of creating a series of modular game assets and quickly realised it would be quicker to write a little script to export it than do the work manually.  It has grown since then, becoming an add-on with multiple export options.

If you have any feedback, either on its functionaly or codebase please let me know :D

and if you want to see additional functionality or have a request for a different type of add on let me know as well.

## Using The Export Helper

I recommend that you create a new scene containing specifically for what you want to export from your blend file.

1. With the 3D viewport open up the side bar ( N Key )
1. Click oin the "Export Helper" Tab
1. Select which file type you wna to export
1. In the same folder your .blend file is a new folder will be created with all of the objects in the scene exported and ready for use externally.

**WARNINGS**
+ *There is no checking for existing files, any thing with the same name will be overwritten.*

+ *Unity Export - The export process will current apply scale and rotation transforms and will make Object_Data unique for all meshes in the scene*
